# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While the public API is still stabilizing (`0.x`), the minor version carries
both new features and breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Per-argument pipes on every transport.** `Piped<P, T>` / `Valid<T>`
  bind on GraphQL, WebSockets, and queue handlers (value-form carriers in
  `nest-rs-pipes`, stripped by `#[resolver]` / `#[messages]` /
  `#[processor]`); HTTP keeps its extractor forms. A rejection surfaces as
  the transport's native error (GraphQL error, WS error frame, job error).
- **Relational predicate scoping.** `p.related::<R, _>(relation, |r| ...)`
  scopes an entity by a condition on a related entity through a typed
  SeaORM relation — lowered to a semi-join (`IN` subquery / correlated
  `EXISTS`), with boot-time guards on the relation target and key arity.
- **Scalar predicate variants.** `p.ne` / `p.lt` / `p.lte` / `p.gt` /
  `p.gte` (`Cmp`) and `p.is_null` / `p.is_not_null` (`IsNull`).
- **Action-typed authorization proofs.** `Authorized<E, A>` carries the
  action as a type parameter, with `bind_required::<S, A>` as the GraphQL
  subject binder — a `Read` proof no longer passes where an `Update` proof
  is required.
- **Generic client-credentials grant helper** in `nest-rs-authn`.
- **Selective `#[crud]` ops with segregated write traits.**
  `ops = [list, get, delete]` synthesises exactly those; the write half
  lives in opt-in `Creatable` / `Updatable` / `Deletable` traits, so a
  read-only resource declares no placeholder input types.
- **Generated list operations paginate by default**, with a hard
  backstop on page size.
- **`ServiceError` carries real 4xx variants** plus `Internal` — features
  stop redefining plumbing errors.
- **`resolve_unique_slug()`** for soft-deletable entities and a **`now()`**
  timestamp helper in `nest-rs-seaorm`.
- **Actor identity on the request span** — denials are attributable
  without per-site threading.
- `nestrs run db down [N]` reverts N migrations (default one step).

### Changed

- **Access and create authorization are decided in SQL.**
  `CrudService::access` re-checks the primary key against
  `condition_for(action)` in the database instead of an in-memory
  `Ability::can` — one source of truth with the list filter, and what
  makes relational rules enforceable on the by-id and create paths.
- **GraphQL posture is mandatory and visible.** Every operation declares
  `#[authorize(Action, Entity)]` (class gate + automatic response
  masking) or `#[public]`; an operation without a posture does not
  compile, and an `Authorized<E>` parameter is not accepted as a
  standalone posture.
- **Transfer objects are named by the boundary they cross** — REST
  `Dto`, queue `Command` / `Event`, GraphQL `Input`; entity-derived
  CRUD forms stay bare (`CreateUser`), with file-role placement to
  match.
- **Framework and product split into two Cargo workspaces** (root
  `crates/nest-rs-*` vs `demo/`), the demo consuming the framework by
  relative path.

### Fixed

- Boot fails with a named error on a duplicate controller prefix
  (previously a panic).
- `#[crud]` GraphQL operation names derive from the snake_case entity
  name.
- `#[public]` is rejected on WS message handlers; OAuth login input
  hardened.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **CLI generators (`nest-rs-cli`).** New scaffolding binary with
  `nestrs g feature/resource/<transport>` — transactional scaffold core that
  generates files and auto-wires modules, with context detection.
- **`nestrs run` task front door.** Single entry point that forwards to `just`
  recipes, with first-run toolchain bootstrap (installs `just`, `bacon`,
  `cargo-nextest`, binstall-preferred; opt out via `--no-bootstrap` /
  `NESTRS_NO_BOOTSTRAP`).
- **Publish suite.** Exemplar workspace with org-scoped posts spanning REST,
  GraphQL, WebSockets, queue, and MCP apps.

### Changed

- **Unified layer pool.** Guards, pipes, interceptors, filters, and
  exception-filters now resolve through a single deduplicated pool per family
  (execute exactly once per request; broadest scope wins).
- **Apps renamed** and **service-naming conventions** tightened across the
  workspace (`svc` / `<name>_svc` injection naming).

### Fixed

- **Security: hardened authn/authz, transports, the data layer, and the CLI**
  against several edge cases.
- **Security: fail closed on unwired MCP** and **enforce a minimum HS256 secret
  length** at boot.
- Access-log `duration_ms` now rounded to microsecond precision.

### Documentation

- Added the Lifecycle fundamentals page and a dedicated packages page.
- Routed all task examples through `nestrs run`.
- Refined the splash hero / landing page (mobile layout, hello code-tabs demo,
  access-log terminal lines) and slimmed the README toward contributors,
  pointing users to nestrs.dev.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-08

Initial public release of the nestrs framework — an opinionated Rust framework
where the developer writes business logic and the framework carries the
cross-cutting concerns (authn, authz, row-level filtering, transactions, edge
validation, discovery, lifecycle).

### Added

- **Composition & DI.** Type-id container with `#[inject]` fields, `#[module]`
  composition, four-phase `App::builder().build()`, singleton/request/transient
  scopes, and a compile-time + boot-time access graph.
- **Request layers.** Guards, pipes, interceptors, filters, and exception
  filters with symmetric scopes (global / controller / handler) and TypeId
  dedup.
- **Transports.** HTTP (`nest-rs-http`), GraphQL (`nest-rs-graphql`),
  WebSockets (`nest-rs-ws`), queue (`nest-rs-queue` + `nest-rs-redis`),
  scheduler (`nest-rs-schedule`), MCP, and OpenAPI (`nest-rs-openapi`).
- **Authn / authz.** `nest-rs-authn` (strategies, `AuthGuard`, `JwtService`)
  and `nest-rs-authz` (abilities, ability guards, response masking) with
  bridges per transport.
- **Data layer.** `nest-rs-seaorm` with transparent ability-scoped `Repo`,
  ambient executor/transaction `task_local!`s, route-model binding, and
  auto-resolved GraphQL relations from `#[expose]`.
- **Supporting crates.** Pipes, events, health, throttler, config,
  opentelemetry, and the `nest-rs` umbrella crate (`use nest_rs::prelude::*`).
- **`nest-rs-*` naming alignment** across directories, packages, and imports;
  framework-owned error types.
- Rust 1.95 / edition 2024; tag-based release CI with the `mold` linker on
  Linux.
