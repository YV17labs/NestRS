## Names — five levels, and none overflows into the next

| Level | Named for | Appears as |
|---|---|---|
| **Project** | the product | the repository and the workspace — **nowhere else** |
| **Family** | the **standard** that names its members | a shared crate-name prefix — and nothing else |
| **Crate** | what it holds | its directory, and the root of every span target it emits |
| **App** | what it **serves** (`api`, `worker`, `auth`) | the binary, and `<App>Module` |
| **Module** | its **domain** (`users`, `billing`) | `<module>/`, `<Module>Module` |

```
<App>Module              the app's own module.rs     composition root
<Module>Module           <module>/module.rs           the port
<Module><Edge>Module     <module>/<edge>/module.rs    one adapter
<WhatItBinds>Module      <name>/module.rs             a substrate
```

**A name and its path say the same thing, and that is the whole law.** From a
path you know the type; from a type you know where the file is. Nothing weaker is
worth having — a reader who has to *learn* which crate holds `SeaOrmDatabaseModule` has
lost the only property naming buys, and a name seen in a stack trace has to
identify itself without the path beside it.

**The stem is the crate's subject plus every folder below `src/`, joined.**

| path | type |
|---|---|
| `nest-rs-http/src/module.rs` | `HttpModule` |
| `nest-rs-throttler/src/module.rs` | `ThrottlerModule` |
| `nest-rs-redis/src/queue/module.rs` | `RedisQueueModule` |
| `nest-rs-redis/src/throttler/module.rs` | `RedisThrottlerModule` |
| `nest-rs-seaorm/src/database/module.rs` | `SeaOrmDatabaseModule` |
| `features/src/audio/http/module.rs` | `AudioHttpModule` |

**A port keeps the bare name; a driver carries its own.** `ThrottlerStore` is
the trait, and its implementations are already `InMemoryThrottler` and
`RedisThrottler` — the module follows the implementation, so
`nest_rs::redis::RedisThrottlerModule` sits beside `RedisThrottler` and says the
same thing. The bare `ThrottlerModule` belongs to `nest-rs-throttler`, which
defines the port. Two consequences, both deliberate: the path stutters
(`redis::RedisQueueModule`), and swapping a backend edits the type name as well
as the import. Both are paid on purpose — **a name that is unambiguous in a log
outranks a name that is short in an import**, and a module name appears in a
composition root, not in fifty call sites.

**An adapter crate is named for the vendor whose types are the developer's
surface** — the storage when the library is hidden (`nest-rs-redis`: apalis is
an implementation detail, `redis::` is what a caller touches), the library when
the library *is* the surface (`nest-rs-seaorm`: entities, `Repo`, `DbErr` are
sea-orm's, and postgres/mysql/sqlite are interchangeable behind its URL). Never
a capability name worn by one backend: that is a port's word, and a port keeps
it.

## Ports & Adapters — three module shapes, and no fourth

The framework is Ports & Adapters as it is practised now: explicit in the
composition root, thin where a library has already done the work, verified by
tests rather than trusted to discipline. A **port** is a crate that defines a
contract *and the semantics that travel with it* — `nest-rs-queue` owns what a
job attempt *is* (the envelope, the trace, the span, the outcome classes, the
events); an **adapter** is a crate named for a vendor that carries *only the
transport* — how to connect, fetch, acknowledge, count. A library that is
already multi-backend (sea-orm, object_store) is **wrapped, never abstracted**:
the wrapper is the adapter, the library is the port, and its URL scheme picks
the backend. Dependency runs one way — the adapter depends on the port, and a
port's dependencies name no vendor crate.

Every module in a composition root is one of three shapes, and a reader learns
the list once:

| Shape | Example | Role | Variables |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<Vendor>Module::for_root(cfg)` | `SeaOrmModule`, `RedisModule` | opens the **resource** — the pool, the connection — once, for every binding in the crate | `NESTRS_<VENDOR>__*` |
| `<Port>Module::for_root(cfg)` | `ThrottlerModule`, `HttpModule`, `HealthModule` | the **capability**: its policy, its guard, its default implementation — when the port has any | `NESTRS_<PORT>__*` |
| `<Vendor><Port>Module` | `SeaOrmDatabaseModule`, `RedisQueueModule`, `RedisThrottlerModule` | **binds** the vendor to the port; a bare import, unless it owns settings of its own — then a `for_root` | `NESTRS_<VENDOR>__<PORT>__*` |

```rust
SeaOrmModule::for_root(None),      SeaOrmDatabaseModule,   SeaOrmHealthModule,
RedisModule::for_root(None),       RedisQueueModule,       RedisWorkerModule::for_root(None),
ThrottlerModule::for_root(None),   RedisThrottlerModule,
HttpModule::for_root(HttpConfig { port: 3002, ..Default::default() }),
```

"Bare or `for_root`" is not a fourth rule; it is the one under *Configuration*:
a module that owns a `#[config]` offers a `for_root`, and one that owns none is
imported bare. A bare import of a module that *does* own one is still legal —
it is a dependency declaration, and the module reads its variables all the same
— so `for_root` in a root is the sign of settings, never their precondition.

**The layout follows.** An adapter crate's root holds the resource —
`src/config.rs`, `src/connection.rs`, `src/module.rs` (the one case a driver's
`src/module.rs` is right: it is a module *of the crate's own subject*, never one
binding wearing the crate's name) — and **one folder per port it binds**:
`queue/`, `worker/`, `throttler/` under `nest-rs-redis`; `database/` and
`health/` under `nest-rs-seaorm`, whose `worker/` holds the job-context bridge
the database binding installs rather than a binding of its own. A binding
folder holds the adapter types (`queue/producer.rs`, `throttler/store.rs`) and
its `module.rs`; what several bindings share sits at the root, and `naming.rs`'s
bindings gate fires on a binding that names a sibling's type. A port crate holds
the contract and its semantics and **no module** when it has nothing to register
(`nest-rs-queue`, `nest-rs-database`): a second queue adapter calls
`nest_rs_queue::consume` for the attempt and writes its fetch loop, nothing
more.

**Swapping or adding a backend edits the composition root and nothing else.**
Two adapters binding one port are a boot error naming both
(`provide_declared_factory`, one shared remedy sentence); a port's default
implementation is an *ordinary* factory, so a vendor binding supersedes it
wherever it sits in `imports`, and a binding that reads another factory's output
declares it (`provide_*_factory_after`), so `imports` order stays a readability
choice. `nest-rs-storage` is the recorded exception to this whole section — a
capability name pinned to S3 — and is fixed by giving it the shape above, not by
documenting it.

**The crate counts only when it is a subject.** Every `nest-rs-*` is named for
what it holds, so it prefixes. A product library like `features` is a container
— its modules are domains, so `audio/http/module.rs` is `AudioHttpModule`, never
`FeaturesAudioHttpModule`.

**Every type in a `module.rs` shares the stem**, not just the module:
`RedisThrottlerModule`, `RedisThrottlerSetup`, `RedisThrottlerHost`. A rename
that leaves a sibling behind is half a rename, and the half left behind is the
one a reader trips on. The same reading gives the adapter's own types —
`posts/http/controller.rs` is `PostsController`, `users/ws/gateway.rs` is
`UsersGateway`.

Enforced, not merely written: `naming.rs` in `nest-rs-conformance` derives every
`module.rs` and every edge adapter in both workspaces and fails on a name that
does not match its path. Its baseline is empty and only shrinks.

**One documented precedence, and it is the only one.** A file whose subject is a
*capability* rather than its module keeps the capability's name — `audio`'s
`TranscodeGuard`, `posts`' `PostAuthorGuard`. That is the rule under
*Precedence* below, it is judgement rather than a scan, and it applies to role
files only: a `module.rs` never takes it.

**No module or provider below the root ever carries the project's or the app's
name.** The project name stops at the workspace; the app name stops at
`<App>Module`. An app may share the project's name only while it is the only
app — and even then, nothing beneath it may. There is no marker exception: a
product module never prefixes itself to stand apart from the framework — see
*The product's own* below.

**A module name is plural when the domain is a collection of enumerable things
(`users`, `orders`), singular when it is a capability (`auth`, `search`).** Not
cosmetic: the generator singularizes the folder name to derive the entity, so a
wrongly pluralized module produces a wrongly named entity, silently.

## Families — a shared prefix names a standard, never a theme

`crates/` is one flat directory, read alphabetically. A shared prefix is
therefore the only grouping a reader is given for free, and it is worth having.
It is also a **claim**, compiled into every path, every span target and every
env var the family owns — so it has to be checkable, not merely helpful.

**A family exists when one external standard names each of its members.** The
prefix takes that standard's subject; the word after it is *read off* the
standard's own vocabulary rather than chosen. RFC 6749 §1.1 enumerates the roles
— *client*, *authorization server*, *resource server* — so the family is:

| Crate | Path a caller types | Read off |
|---|---|---|
| `nest-rs-oauth-client` | `nest_rs::oauth::client` | §1.1 *client* |
| `nest-rs-oauth-server` | `nest_rs::oauth::server` | §1.1 *authorization server* |
| `nest-rs-oauth-resource` | `nest_rs::oauth::resource` | §1.1 *resource server* |

**The membership test must be answerable by someone who did not write the code.**
*Does this standard name this thing?* is such a test. *Is this about auth?* is
not. A family whose membership is argued will be argued again, and every
re-argument renames crates — which is the cost the level exists to stop.

**No crate carries the prefix alone.** A name that is both a level and a member
denotes two things at once, and that breaks the property the whole model buys:
from a type you know the path. The family is `oauth`, so there is no
`nest-rs-oauth`.

**A theme is not a family.** Grouping *everything about auth* is a reading aid,
and reading aids belong in the documentation's own sections, which group without
asserting anything about what the code does. Alphabetical order already puts a
theme's members side by side; a prefix additionally states that the standard
above them is shared, which is a stronger claim and usually a false one.

**Recorded so it is not re-derived: `authn-*` / `authz-*` was considered, and the
standards retire it.** The instinct is sound — authentication and authorization
*are* the two halves of this territory — but the resulting family cannot be
tested. RFC 6749 titles itself *The OAuth 2.0 **Authorization** Framework*, so a
client and an authorization server are authz; social login is authentication
performed *through* that authorization flow; a JWT verifier serves both, because
one token carries the identity and the scopes; and RFC 9728 discovery is served
to callers who have no identity at all, so it is neither. One member in five
classifies without argument. `authn` and `authz` stay as **crate** names — the
pair is real, and it is the pair a reader wants — but they name two crates, not
two families.

## The product's own — what the product decides, and nothing else

A product module is named for its domain and its name is derived from its path
like any other — `features/authn/module.rs` is `AuthnModule`, whether or not the
framework happens to export a type of that name. **No marker is ever added to
tell a product name apart from a framework one.** A product name is local and a
framework name is global, and the path a caller already types separates them.

**This does not reach the framework's own crates, and the two rules do not
compete.** *A port keeps the bare name; a driver carries its own subject* binds
`nest-rs-redis`, and it still does: `Redis` is a **subject**, so
`RedisThrottlerModule` says which backend a log line came from at no cost but
length. The product has no such word — the marker considered here was `App`,
which names nothing, and a marker that carries no subject buys no
identification, only length. So the framework keeps paying and the product
stops.

**Two colliding idents cannot both be imported into one file**, so where the
product's own name equals the framework's, the framework's is written in full
at the point of use — not aliased, and not renamed:

```rust
// features/src/authn/module.rs — the product's AuthnModule binds the framework's
#[module(imports = [nest_rs::authn::AuthnModule::for_root(None)])]
pub struct AuthnModule;
```

That qualified path is **mandatory, not a preference**: `use … as` is not an
escape either, because `#[module]` records `ModuleDescriptor.name` from the
struct's own ident at its *definition* site. That descriptor label is the one
place in the framework where a name appears without its path — it is what
`AccessGraphError` and `UnresolvedDependencyError` print. Everything else is
path-qualified and unaffected: `ContestedDeclarationError` carries
`std::any::type_name::<T>()`, and a provider's label is the last segment of the
path **as written** in `providers = [...]`, so an alias does rename it.

Nothing collides in this repo today — `nest_rs::authn::AuthnModule` is a
hand-written dynamic module with no `#[module]`, so it files no descriptor and
no boot line. **Whether the framework should absorb such a binding entirely —
`AuthnModule::for_root::<S>(cfg)` registering the strategy and its guard, so the
product declares no module at all — is an open question for the owner**, not a
decided remedy: it is possible and unbuilt, and writing it as settled would put
a claim in the rules that nothing has tested.

**A prefixed variant was tried and removed; recorded so it is not re-proposed.**
`app_authn` / `AppAuthnModule` triggered on the *namespace* the umbrella
re-exports rather than on the ident, so fourteen of seventeen marked types
carried a marker that distinguished them from nothing — `nest-rs-authz` exports
no `AuthzModule`, and `nest-rs-oauth-server` exports no module at all. A marker
that is right for three names and noise for fourteen is not a convention.

**What is not the product's own does not live in the product.** Anything a
module holds that *every* consumer would write identically — a wire shape a
specification fixes, a token a framework seam requires, a default nobody varies
— is the framework's. Left in the app it is a copy waiting to drift from the
thing it duplicates, and the drift is silent because nothing joins the two. **It
moves up.** What stays is what this product *decides*: its claims, its policy,
its scopes, its validation rules.

Two tells, and both have been found here:

- **The fields are a specification's own field names.** `AccessTokenResponse`'s
  `access_token` / `token_type` / `expires_in` are RFC 6749 §5.1, so no
  conforming issuer can spell them otherwise. The framework already held §5.2's
  `TokenError` — one half of one response in the framework and the other half in
  the app is the asymmetry this rule names.
- **The type has no members at all.** A struct declared only so a macro has a
  concrete provider to gate on says nothing about the product; the seam that
  demands it should declare it.

This is *One declaration, every site the standard permits* read from the other
end: there the framework owes every site an answer, here the product owes the
framework anything that was never its own.

## Modules — two files, two jobs, never merged

| File | Job | Answers to | Holds |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mod.rs` | which **files** exist, and **what leaves the module** | the compiler, and readers | `//!`, `mod`, `pub use` |
| `module.rs` | which **providers** exist, what is imported | the framework | exactly one `#[module]` |

`module.rs` is the DI module. `mod.rs` is both the folder index *and* the
export contract: **its `pub use` list is what the rest of the workspace may
reach.** `pub` means exported; everything else is `pub(crate)` or private. A
`mod.rs` that re-exports everything cancels the encapsulation — that list is a
decision, not plumbing.

**No `*_module.rs`, ever.** One `#[module]` per file, one `module.rs` per
folder; two modules in a feature means two folders.

## Configuration — one seam per config, decided by ownership

A `#[config]` is reached through **exactly one** seam. Which one follows from
who owns it, and there is no judgement call:

| Whose config | Seam | In-code path |
|---|---|---|
| a **library** module's, in its own namespace | `Module::for_root(cfg)` | `for_root` — the base the env overlays, per field |
| **yours**, declared by your own module | `ConfigModule::for_feature::<C>()` | `impl Default` — you own the struct, so you edit it |
| nobody's (a discovered plugin) | its registry entry reads its own namespace | none — credentials are deployment data |

The split is *who can edit the struct*. You cannot touch `HttpConfig::default`,
so `HttpModule::for_root(cfg)` is the only way to set a port from code — which
is why the dual-path rule binds every `nest-rs-*` module. Your own
`IssuerConfig` needs no seam: its `impl Default` **is** the in-code path, and
adding a `for_root` nobody calls is speculative API in the exemplar people copy.
Write one the day an app needs to pin your config from outside your crate.

**`ConfigModule::for_root()` is the one homonym** — it takes no config and
configures no module. It switches on the `.env` cascade, and goes first in the
root's imports. Everything below is about `Module::for_root(x)`, which is a
different thing wearing the same name (NestJS's, kept deliberately).

**`for_root` configures; `for_feature` registers.** They are not two ways to do
one thing, and `for_feature` deliberately takes no value: a config reachable
through two seams is a config whose value depends on `imports = [..]` order.
A library module therefore writes **both** — `for_feature` in its `imports` so
the config always loads, and a `for_root` so a caller can pin it:

```rust
#[module(imports = [ConfigModule::for_feature::<StorageConfig>()], providers = [Storage])]
pub struct StorageModule;

impl StorageModule {
    pub fn for_root(config: impl Into<Option<StorageConfig>>) -> StorageSetup {
        ConfigModule::setup(config)
    }
}

pub type StorageSetup = ConfigSetup<StorageModule, StorageConfig>;
```

That is the whole seam when `for_root` only pins — reach for `ConfigSetup`
rather than hand-rolling a `*Setup`. Write your own only when `collect` queues
more than the config (a pool, a client) or `register` does more than recurse.

**The converse is load-bearing: a module that owns no config gets no
`for_root`.** *Owns* means its own namespace, never a config belonging to
something it merely discovers — `SocialModule` discovers providers that each
carry their own `#[config]`, so it stays a bare import with no seam at all.
Giving it one forces a list of unrelated config types, hence type erasure,
hence no duplicate detection.

**A `#[config]`'s namespace is its stem, exactly as its type name is — read,
never chosen.** The segments are the crate's subject, then every folder below
`src/` on the way to the file that is not a pluralised role folder, joined by
`__` — the same derivation that names the module types, so the variable and the
code say one thing: `http/src/config.rs` → `HttpConfig` → `NESTRS_HTTP__*`;
`seaorm/src/config.rs` → `SeaOrmConfig` → `NESTRS_SEAORM__URL`;
`redis/src/worker/config.rs` → `RedisWorkerConfig` →
`NESTRS_REDIS__WORKER__*`; `social/src/providers/github/config.rs` →
`NESTRS_SOCIAL__GITHUB__*` (`providers/` is a role folder, so it is not a
segment — and the type there, `GithubSocialConfig`, takes the member-first name
the role tables give a provider's files). From a variable a reader knows the
file and the module that reads it; from a module they know the variable. The
vendor is in the variable when the vendor is in the path — never one without
the other — and `NESTRS_DATABASE__URL`, the universal convention, is exactly
what this forbids: a word that names neither the crate nor the type that parses
it. Enforced by `namespace_is_the_stem` in `naming.rs`.

**Pinning by seeding (`App::builder().provide(cfg)`) is not a seam** — a seed
short-circuits the resolving factory and freezes that whole namespace against
the deployment. It is the hermetic-test hatch, and nothing else.

You cannot get any of this wrong silently — the boot enforces it:

- a pinned base **supersedes** a bare import's env-only factory, wherever the
  two fall in `imports`;
- two pinned bases for one config **fail the boot** naming it
  (`ContestedDeclarationError`) — as do two modules binding the same
  implementation, which is how importing both throttler backends is caught;
- a config the synchronous `App::new` could never resolve **fails the boot**
  too (`UnresolvedFactoryError`), instead of surfacing as a `None` much later.

## Providers — three questions, in order

`#[module]` takes only `imports` and `providers`. There is no `controllers`
list, so the *mechanism* cannot say what a thing is for. **The name has to.**
Answer these before naming anything.

**Q1 — is it listed in `providers`?** No ⇒ it is not a provider. It is either
something the framework *consumes* without injecting (an entity, a `#[config]`,
a DTO the validator reads) or plain vocabulary (an enum, a type alias, a set of
constants). Both are named by the tables below; neither needs a module of its
own. **Only something injected by type needs a module.**

**Q2 — who calls it?** The framework, *because of what it is* ⇒ **primitive**:
the vocabulary is closed, you pick from it rather than invent. Your own code
⇒ **custom** ⇒ Q3.

**Q3 — does it own domain logic?** Yes ⇒ it is a **`Service`**, and that is the
residue by design. No ⇒ name it for **what it is** — a factory, a client, a
store, a bridge, a registry, a transport seam — and never `Service`.

## Naming tables

File name = role, folder = module. Snake_case, no dotted variants, **one role
→ one file per folder**.

**Mounted or injected primitives.** The framework dispatches to these; the file
is named for the role, never for the type.

| Role | File |
|---|---|
| DI module (exactly one `#[module]` struct per file) | `module.rs` |
| Folder index (`pub use` / `mod` only) | `mod.rs` |
| Service | `service.rs` / `services/` |
| Controller (REST) / Resolver (GraphQL) / Gateway (WS) | `http/controller.rs` / `graphql/resolver.rs` / `ws/gateway.rs` |
| Processor (queue) / Scheduled tasks / Tool (MCP) | `queue/processor.rs` / `schedule/tasks.rs` / `mcp/tool.rs` |
| Event listener host | `events/listener.rs` |
| Entity (ORM + `#[expose]`) | `entity.rs` / `entities/` |
| Guard / Strategy / Pipe | `guard.rs` / `strategy.rs` / `pipe.rs` |
| Interceptor / Filter / Exception filter | `interceptor.rs` / `filter.rs` / `exception_filter.rs` |
| Module config (`#[config]`) | `config.rs` |
| Domain error / Static constants | `error.rs` / `constants.rs` |

An adapter role carries its folder: `schedule/tasks.rs`, never `tasks.rs` at
the module root. A transport-specific guard belongs to its adapter too
(`mcp/guard.rs`).

**The layer roles are on the table because they are dispatched to.** An
`#[interceptor]`, a `#[filter]` and an exception filter are mounted by the
framework exactly as a guard or a pipe is, so they are named for the role and
not for the type. The rule above binds them the same way: a layer that exists
to serve one transport sits in that transport's folder
(`http/interceptor.rs`), and a layer a module applies to itself whatever the
edge sits flat at the module root.

**A crate whose whole subject is one layer keeps it at the crate root.** There
is no `http/` folder to carry when the crate serves one edge and nothing else —
`nest-rs-server-timing`'s `interceptor.rs` is the whole crate, and wrapping it
in a folder would name an adapter the crate has no second of. The folder
separates *several* adapters within one module; it is not a suffix the role
carries everywhere.

**Custom providers.** Injectable, but nothing is dispatched *to* them. Named
for what they are, file named the same, and **never folded into `service.rs`**.
A recognised word beats an invented one: `Factory`, `Client`, `Store`,
`Registry`, `Source`, `Bridge`.

**Vocabulary.** Not registered anywhere: an enum, a struct, a type alias, a set
of constants. Named for *what it declares* — a role suffix on vocabulary is
noise, and *what it declares* is not a matter of taste:

**The file and its folder, read together, spell the type.** One of the two
names the *kind*, never both and never neither, and every shape that takes is
already in the framework you import — so each one below is a path you can open:

- **The kind is the subject**, so neither word has to add one — `seaorm/src/repo.rs`
  is `Repo`, `core/src/container.rs` is `Container`, `queue/src/queue_name.rs`
  is `QueueName`.
- **The file names the kind**, and the type prepends the subject —
  `redis/src/connection.rs` is `RedisConnection`, `events/src/bus.rs` is
  `EventBus`, `worker/src/context.rs` is `JobContext`.
- **The folder names the kind**, and the file names the subject —
  `pipes/src/pipes/validation.rs` is `ValidationPipe`,
  `oauth/strategies/oauth.rs` is `OAuthStrategy`.

**One shape is refused, and only one: a stem that appears nowhere in what the
file declares.** No example of it is given above, and that is the point — the
framework holds none, because a real one is a defect to fix rather than a case
to publish, so this is the half of the rule that has to be *applied* rather
than recognised. Apply it as a question: **does either name reach the other?** When
no word of the stem reaches the type and no word of the type reaches the stem,
the file was named for a *slot* — "who acts", "what we pass around" — instead of
a subject, and a slot has no admission test, so the next type about that slot
lands there too. It is `shared/` at the scale of a file, and it is invisible
from outside: both names read perfectly well on their own, and only the pair is
wrong.

Everything short of that passes, and the tolerance is deliberate — a tighter
test, the stem as the type's first or last word, reads well and is false on a
third of this framework:

- **The shared word may come from the folder rather than the file.**
  `throttler/store.rs` holds `RedisThrottler`, `worker/consumer.rs` holds
  `RedisWorker`: a binding file names the *seam*, the type names the *thing
  that fills it*, and it is the adapter's own vocabulary — `InMemoryThrottler`
  beside `RedisThrottler` — that a reader matches on.
- **An inflection is the same word**, and so is a word in the middle:
  `scope.rs` holds `Scoped`, `logging.rs` holds `LogFormat`, `token.rs` holds
  `AccessTokenRequest`. This is why the rule is *read* and not run — `naming.rs`
  mechanises what a path derives, and English morphology is not that.
- **A recognised word is a role, not vocabulary.** `registry.rs`, `client.rs`,
  `store.rs`, `factory.rs`, `source.rs`, `bridge.rs` and `inventory.rs` are
  named by the custom-provider paragraph above and take its pairing
  (`<Subject>Registry`); this rule is for the files no table names.

**Executed, not merely written.** `nestrs lint` runs this pairing over a
project's `src/`, and the framework's conformance suite runs *the same code*
over its own tree — so the rule shipped and the rule met are one symbol rather
than two implementations that drift. It refuses only what this paragraph
refuses; every tolerance below is a pass, and files a table already names are
skipped.

**A file whose principal export is not a type is a namespace, and owes nothing
above.** `queue/src/consume.rs` exports `consume::discover` and
`consume::attempt`; the `Attempt` it also declares is that procedure's
vocabulary rather than the file's subject. The stem names what a caller
*calls*, and the call site reads it as part of the name. A file whose subject
*is* a type owes the pairing.

**Vocabulary sits flat at the module root.** It is never gathered into
`types/`, `model/`, `common/` or `shared/`: a folder named for who uses it has
no admission test, so nothing can ever be refused from it and it fills. A
module root that feels crowded is a module to split, not vocabulary to bury.

**The same holds one level up, and rules out a `shared` crate.** The crate
table names a crate for *what it holds*; "shared" and "common" name *who
reaches for it*, so they admit anything and refuse nothing. A substrate crate
is shared *because* it holds the substrate, never the other way round — and if
the subject cannot be named in one noun, the sharing is accidental: the
vocabulary belongs to the module that owns it, and a second consumer is the
signal that two modules were drawn wrong.

**`core` is the one positional word that survives, and it survives on a test.**
It names the kernel rather than an audience, and a kernel is checkable: *every
other crate in the workspace composes on it, and it composes on none of them*.
`nest-rs-core` passes — the container, the module system, the access graph, the
lifecycle and the trace context, depended on by all and depending on no
sibling. A `core` that fails that test is a `shared` wearing a better word.

Shared test doubles are the one crate-root file: `testing.rs`, behind
`#[cfg(test)]`, doubles only.

## Precedence — when a type carries a primitive role *and* logic

A primitive role wins **only when the framework is the sole caller and the file
holds no domain logic**. `tasks.rs` earns its name when the clock is the only
caller and the work it drives lives in a service; otherwise it is a service
that happens to have a trigger. Same test for `#[hooks]`, `#[listeners]` and a
health indicator: a lifecycle hook or a scheduled tick never renames a service.

## Several of the same role

Pluralized sub-folder; the singular trait file stays at the parent. **The
folder exists to carry *several*, so one of a kind is a file**: `dtos/` holds
`login_dto.rs` beside `signup_dto.rs`, while a module with a single transfer
object writes `dto.rs` at its root. A plural folder holding one file names a
collection that is not there.

| Folder | File | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Providers — `services/`, `strategies/`, `pipes/` | bare: `input.rs` | `InputService` |
| Entities — `entities/` | bare: `user.rs` | `User` |
| Transfer objects — `dtos/`, `commands/`, `events/` | suffixed: `login_dto.rs` | `LoginDto` |

A provider's role is spelled by its folder *and* its type, so the file does not
spell it a third time. A transfer object is read far from its folder — in a
handler signature — so it keeps the suffix at both sites.

**Two services in one module is a last resort.** Extracting a factory, a client
or an enum leaves the count at one, and that is the common case. Reach for
`services/` only when the module owns two bodies of domain logic.

## Folders

- A module that is not a feature still gets a folder — cross-cutting wiring
  imported once by the root is `<name>/module.rs`, never a top-level
  `<name>.rs`. A hand-written `impl Module` is still a DI module.
- **A module's sub-folders are a closed set of two kinds**: transport adapters
  and pluralized role folders (`services/`, `entities/`, `dtos/`, …). **There
  is no third kind.** A folder invented to group "things that go together" —
  `contract/`, `types/`, `core/`, `shared/`, `common/`, `interfaces/` — is a
  defect: every file it would hold is already named by a table above (a trait
  lives with its concern), so it sits flat beside
  its siblings. A folder that feels too full means the module is too big; split
  the module, never the vocabulary.
- **The edge vocabulary is closed**: `http`, `graphql`, `ws`, `queue`,
  `schedule`, `mcp`, `events`. The *form* is open — a new edge follows
  `<edge>/module.rs` + `<Module><Edge>Module` — but adding one is a framework
  change, not a local improvisation.
- **A file under `<edge>/` serves that edge and nothing else.** The folder is a
  statement about the file, exactly as a type's name is a statement about its
  path, and a file answering two edges from inside one of them makes that
  statement false. So a type the framework dispatches to at several edges — one
  guard implementing `check_http`, `check_graphql`, `check_ws_message` and
  `check_mcp`, one layer bound at more than one — sits **at the level every edge
  it answers can reach**: the crate root, or the module root beside the edge
  folders. Not in the folder of whichever edge asked for it first.

  This one is worth stating because it is the hardest to see from the inside.
  `nest-rs-authz/src/http/guard.rs` held exactly such a guard through 5.1 and the
  name was never wrong — `AbilityGuard` reads correctly anywhere. Only its
  *location* was, and it cost three transports the HTTP feature to reach their
  own guard, put the WS entry behind `http`, and made three of the demo's four
  `Authz<Edge>Module`s import an HTTP adapter they never served. The reverse is
  **not** a law: a crate whose whole subject is one edge keeps its role files at
  the root (`nest-rs-server-timing`'s `interceptor.rs`), because a folder
  separates several adapters and there are none to separate.

  Mechanised by `no_file_under_an_edge_folder_answers_another_edge` in
  `naming.rs`, which derives each edge's dispatch surface from the framework's
  own `pub trait` declarations rather than listing it. Two things it cannot see
  and a reviewer therefore owes: an edge-bound trait that does not name its edge
  (`SocketContext`, `RouteResponseShaper`), and an alias whose aliased type is
  the thing answering several edges.
- `mod.rs` / `lib.rs` carry `//!`, `mod` and `pub use` — no logic.
- Injected service field is `svc` when there is one, `<name>_svc` when there
  are several. Non-service dependencies keep descriptive names (`db`, `queue`,
  `config`).

## Reserved vocabulary

**A module may not take a name from the structural vocabulary.** These words
already mean something to the layout, and reusing one makes every path
ambiguous. Pick the domain word instead — a module about desktop applications
is `programs`, not `apps`.

```
structure   apps  crates  features  src  tests
roles       mod  module  service  controller  resolver  gateway  tool
            processor  tasks  listener  guard  strategy  pipe  config
            interceptor  filter
            entity  error  constants  testing
singulars   dto  command  event
plurals     services  entities  dtos  commands  events  strategies  pipes
edges       http  graphql  ws  queue  schedule  mcp  events
```

## Transfer objects — named for the boundary they cross

| Kind | Suffix |
|---|---|
| REST body, in or out | `Dto` — `LoginDto` |
| Queue payload, imperative ("do X", verb-led) | `Command` — `TranscodeCommand` |
| Queue payload, published fact (past tense) | `Event` — `OrderPlacedEvent` |
| WS message payload | `Dto` — `SendMessageDto` |
| GraphQL input, hand-written | `Input` |

A queue payload is a producer↔worker contract, so it lives at the port and the
processor imports it. The entity is the exception: it stays `Model` in
`entity.rs`, its `#[expose]`d wire struct keeps the bare entity name, and the
generated `Create<E>` / `Update<E>` are bare too.
