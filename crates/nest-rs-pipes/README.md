# nest-rs-pipes

Transport-agnostic validation & transformation pipes for NestRS, applied at the request boundary by the transport that owns it.

Part of [NestRS](https://nestrs.dev) — every framework crate ships at the same version in lockstep, under a semver contract: breaking changes wait for the next major.

```sh
cargo add nest-rs --features pipes
```

Reached through the [`nest-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/nest-rs) umbrella: one dependency, one feature per capability. Adding this crate directly is supported but not the documented path — a decorator's expansion roots itself at `nest_rs::…`.
