//! Link-time registry of `#[scheduled]` method jobs, submitted by
//! `nest_rs_schedule_macros::scheduled` on a per-method basis, plus the
//! synthesized [`CronJobMeta`] the [`Scheduler`](crate::Scheduler) builds
//! from each entry.
//!
//! `#[scheduled]` lets a single `#[injectable]` provider own several scheduled
//! methods sharing the same `#[inject]` deps. Each method submits one
//! [`ScheduledMethod`] here; [`crate::Scheduler`] drains the registry at boot
//! and filters by
//! [`ReachableProviders`](::nest_rs_core::ReachableProviders) so a job whose
//! provider is not in the app's module tree is silently skipped — same
//! module-gating as the rest of the discovery system.
//!
//! The `attach_meta::<…, CronJobMeta>` path remains for direct, test-friendly
//! registration; [`crate::Scheduler`] merges both sources.
