//! [`InMemoryThrottler`] — fixed-window counter shared process-wide, plus the
//! [`ThrottlerStore`] trait it implements (the extension seam for alternative
//! backends like a Redis-backed sliding-window store).
//!
//! Each bucket carries its own window: [`InMemoryThrottler::hit`] evicts an
//! entry only once **its own** window has elapsed (never the current caller's),
//! so a hit on a short-window route can't purge a counter opened under a
//! long-window one. A `MAX_KEYS` cap bounds the live set; beyond expiry the map
//! is otherwise unbounded — acceptable for the in-process default, where a
//! future Redis store would handle expiry natively.
//!
//! **Scope is per-process, by design.** The counter lives in this replica's
//! memory, so N replicas of an app give a client up to N× the configured limit
//! on an auth-sensitive endpoint. That is a deliberate trade for the
//! zero-dependency default; deployments that need a global limit implement
//! [`ThrottlerStore`] over a shared store (Redis) and bind that guard instead.
