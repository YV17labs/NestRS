# NestRS docs — style & structure norm

This file is the **single source of truth** for how docs pages are written. It exists because the
corpus was authored across many LLM/human sessions and drifted into dialects. The norm lives in
the repo — enforced by `docs/scripts/lint-docs.mjs` in CI — so a new session cannot ship a new
dialect unnoticed. When in doubt on any page, apply these rules.

Derived from the content audit (`DOCS_AUDIT.md` §0.2bis + §0.3). On conflict about docs prose,
this file and the audit win; on conflict about code or naming, `CLAUDE.md` wins.

## The goal

The docs must be the best on the market for **developers and software architects** evaluating or
implementing the framework. Four operating rules:

1. **Make them want it (SELL).** Reinforce the thesis — *you write business logic; the framework
   carries the rest* — with working code and verifiable evidence, not adjectives.
2. **Simple first (PATH).** The 80% case in the first screen of every page. Complexity is allowed,
   but always *behind* the simple case — progressive disclosure, advanced material marked as
   advanced.
3. **Never repeat — link (DRY).** Every concept has exactly ONE canonical page. Other pages get
   one sentence plus a link.
4. **Intuitive structure.** Categories and ordering follow the reader's journey, not the crate
   layout.

## A. Controlled H2 vocabulary

Structural section headings use **only** these names, in canonical order where present:

`Install` → `Run it` → `Wire it in` → *(page-specific content sections)* → `Configuration` →
`Limits` → `What fails if you get it wrong` → `Reference` → `Going further`

Page-specific *content* headings are free. Structural blocks use only the controlled names.

**Banned heading variants** (normalize on sight):

| Banned | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Wiring it up, Wire it into the app | Wire it in |
| Where to go next, Next steps, See also, Going deeper | Going further |

The normative closing block is **`## Going further`** (the majority convention). Utility/terminal
pages are exempt (see the linter's exempt list): `404`, `glossary`, `decorators`, env-var
reference.

## B. One template per page type

- **T-CONCEPT** (reference/concept page, the majority type): frontmatter (`title`, one-sentence
  `description` stating the single question the page answers) → opening paragraph (what you'll
  have at the end, ≤ 3 sentences) → first working snippet (≤ ~15 lines, **no Aside above it**) →
  `Install` + `Wire it in` (if applicable) → the 80% case → variations → `### Advanced`-gated
  material → `Limits` (one consolidated section) → `Going further` (2–4 links).
- **T-INDEX** (section landing): opening paragraph → minimal end-to-end example → "In this
  section" list (matching sidebar order) → `Going further`.
- **T-TUTORIAL** (tutorial step): goal sentence → numbered `<Steps>` each ending with expected
  output → one "what just happened" paragraph → link to the owning reference page → `Going
  further` pointing to the next step only.
- **T-RECIPE** (how-to, add-login shape): problem statement → prerequisites (one line) → numbered
  steps with checkpoints → `What fails if you get it wrong` → `Going further`.
- **T-SINGLE** (single-page section like server-timing): T-CONCEPT with `Install`/`Run it`
  mandatory in the first screen.

Skeletons live in `docs/templates/`.

## C. Component conventions

- `<Aside type="tip">` = optional shortcut; `note` = context the reader may skip; `caution` =
  footgun with consequences. **≤ 3 Asides total per page.**
- `<Steps>` for any numbered procedure.
- `<Tabs syncKey=…>` only for genuine alternatives (workspace/standalone).
- Code fence titles: a `title="…"` naming a real repo path must match that file byte-for-byte or
  say "(abridged)". Fictional examples get generic `src/…` titles, never a real-looking repo path.
  Fence titles cite the **user's** workspace shape (`crates/features/…`); GitHub URLs use the real
  repo paths (`demo/crates/features/…`).
- Terminal transcripts: `$`-prefixed input lines, trimmed output (≤ ~8 meaningful lines), no
  fabricated sequencing (a log line never appears before the command that causes it).
- One `Piped` destructuring style, one boot-log format across pages.

## D. The anti-drowning charter (simplicity is a budget)

1. **Page budgets.** A reference page: ≤ ~250–300 lines, answers **one question** (the one its
   frontmatter description states). A tutorial page: ≤ ~250 lines, ends on a runnable checkpoint.
   Per page: ≤ 3 Asides; scattered cautions consolidate into **one `Limits` section**; the first
   screen is one working snippet (≤ ~15 lines) with **no Aside above it**.
2. **Evidence placement.** Proof follows the promise it proves. Never a failure demo before the
   reader's first success. Boot/compile errors live under `What fails if you get it wrong` *after*
   the 80% case. Verbatim outputs are real (run it once, paste it), trimmed to ≤ ~8 lines. **Each
   evidence artifact appears once site-wide** — every other page links to it.
3. **Competitor mentions.** Named competitors (NestJS, BullMQ, Socket.IO, Sidekiq, Hasura…) appear
   **only** on the landing, `why.mdx`, and the comparison page. Reference pages sell by
   demonstration.
4. **Prose style charter.** Second person, present tense, active voice. Average sentence ≤ ~22
   words. **Banned words** (the linter greps): *blazing(ly), powerful, seamless(ly), simply,
   effortless(ly), easy, magic(al)*. **No exclamation marks in prose.** The voice is a calm senior
   engineer showing you something that works — never a brochure.
5. **Table-vs-prose.** Tables only for parallel lookup facts (≥ 3 rows, comparable columns).
   Decisions and narratives stay prose. No single-row tables.
6. **Link discipline.** Glossary link on first use per page only, never in headings or code
   captions; ≤ ~2 inline links per paragraph outside `Going further` blocks.

## E. The example canon — one universe

One product universe — **Publish** — with one canonical feature per concern. Never invent a
feature. A docs example is either (a) a quote/abridgement of a real demo file (fence title = real
path, "(abridged)" when trimmed), or (b) a minimal fictional snippet **inside the canon domain**
with a generic `src/…` title.

**The one escape — a concept with no canon home.** Some pages teach a shape the Publish universe
has no feature for: the app's own claims module, an external service you depend on. Those name a
**neutral placeholder** rather than a second product (`identity`, which is also what `nestrs g
auth` scaffolds; `upstream` for a third-party dependency). The test is whether the canon *could*
have carried it: a pure calculation, a CRUD slice or a migration walkthrough always can, so it
takes `posts` / `users` / `orgs` and inventing a name there is the violation this rule names. The
linter greps a ban list and cannot see this — it is a review call.

**Ban list** (the linter greps; must return zero): `items`/`ItemsService`, `products`/
`ProductEntity`, `artworks`, `file_assets`, `points`/`Ledger`, ad-hoc greetings outside the hello
scaffold.

| Docs area | Canonical example |
|---|---|
| Landing, Getting started | `hello` (greeting) |
| Tutorial + Fundamentals | `blog` app, `posts` feature |
| HTTP, Validation, Database, Pagination | `posts` |
| Relations, row-level, masking, by-id | `users` + `orgs` |
| Security (authn/authz) | `users`/`orgs` + the `auth` app |
| GraphQL | `users` (+ `org` relation) |
| WebSockets | `chat` / `notify` (`demo/apps/live`) |
| Queue + Schedule | `audio` / `TranscodeCommand` (`demo/apps/worker`) |
| Events | `PostPublishedEvent` (notifications listener) |
| MCP | `weather` (+ `hello` tool) (`demo/apps/assistant`) |
| OpenAPI, Health, Rate limiting, OTel, Testing | the `api` app over `users`/`posts` |
| Storage | post cover-image upload (`media` slice) |

## F. Code truth — the checks the prose rules can't see

Style is half the job; a page that reads well and does not run is still a defect. Each of these
was filed against a shipped release by a reader following a page verbatim, so the linter now
greps for them:

- **`version-pin`** — a literal `nest-rs* = "X.Y"` (either manifest form) must match
  `[workspace.package] version` in the repo root `Cargo.toml`, which is also what
  `nestrs g resource` writes. Bump the release, bump the pages — or use `workspace = true`,
  which carries no version at all.
- **`unauthed-curl`** — a `curl` naming a concrete host and a guarded REST root (`/posts`,
  `/users`, `/orgs`, …) carries an `Authorization` header. The guards run before the pipe and
  before the handler, so a token-free call documents a `401` the page never mentions. A block
  demonstrating the denial (`401`/`403` in its own output) is exempt — that is the point of it.
  `/graphql` is out of scope: one endpoint, per-operation posture.
- **`crud-error`** — a **handler** snippet must not `?` a `CrudService` read (`list()`, `page(`,
  `access(`). Those return `Result<_, DbErr>`, and `DbErr` is not a `ResponseError`: the line
  does not compile. The fix is a layering one, not a `map_err` at the route — the exemplar's
  services return the **wire type** (`demo/…/posts/service.rs`: `create_in_org` → `Post`), so a
  hand-written handler is a one-line delegation and the `Model` → wire conversion plus the
  `ServiceError` mapping live in the service. Only handler blocks are checked; a service body
  converting `DbErr` through `?` is the correct shape.
- **`install-stanza`** — a page that publishes its install list twice **under `## Install`** (a
  `cargo add` line in a `bash` block, a `[dependencies]` block in `toml`) must have the two say
  the same thing: same
  crates, same features, same `default-features`, and an explicit `@<req>` on the `cargo add`
  whenever the manifest constrains past the major. The reader runs the bash line first, so the
  half that drifts is the half that breaks: 1.3.0 shipped `cargo add validator` (resolving 0.21)
  above a `validator = "0.20"` pin, a `/database/` `cargo add` with every feature dropped, and a
  `/mcp/` stanza naming neither crate `#[mcp]` expands to. Blocks written `workspace = true` are
  not install stanzas and are skipped.
- **`otel-guard`** — a snippet binding `OpenTelemetry::init` uses the name the crate's own boot
  panic prescribes, read out of `nest-rs-opentelemetry`'s panic text rather than restated. 1.3.0
  corrected the panic to `let _otel =` and left the page's canonical `main` on
  `let _opentelemetry =`, so the reader who tripped the panic was told to write a line the
  example he started from did not contain.

## Running the linter

```
cd docs
npm run lint:docs              # fails on any violation not in the baseline
npm run lint:docs -- --update-baseline   # re-snapshot known violations (shrinks toward zero)
```

The linter is **baseline-gated**: `docs/scripts/lint-baseline.json` records currently-tolerated
violations so CI fails only on *new* dialect drift. As pages are brought to conformance the
baseline shrinks; when it is empty the linter gates the whole corpus.
